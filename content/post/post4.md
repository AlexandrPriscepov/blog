Markdown is a simple syntax that formats text as headers, lists, boldface, and so on. This markup language is popular, and you definitely have apps that support it. Here’s a quick primer on what Markdown is, and how and where you can use it.
What Is Markdown?

When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you’re “formatting” it. Markdown is a syntax—or, set of rules—that formats text on web pages.

Traditionally, to format text on web pages, people used Hypertext Markup Language, better known as HTML. HTML is one member of the family of markup languages, along with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).S

The tags, however, make it quite difficult for humans to read HTML and understand how the text will look after the computer renders it. It’s not very “user-friendly” for people who don’t have a lot of experience reading it.

Markdown, on the other hand, is meant “to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.” John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz explain why they created Markdown in 2004 and provide a guide to the syntax on Gruber’s website.

In short, Markdown makes it easier to format text for web pages because its tags are simpler than HTML, and they convert to HTML automatically. This means you don’t have to know HTML to write something for a web page because Markdown translates your tags into HTML for you.
