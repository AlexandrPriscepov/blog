Data science is still an emerging field and thus has a high-demand and lucrative job market. But for anyone looking to break into the data science industry, getting started can be daunting. 

Some people go back to college, some teach themselves, and some attend data science bootcamps.

Regardless of which path you pick, though, data science involves high coding expertise. And like with many technical fields, skill demand and expectations are always evolving. In this year 2021, here are the best data science programming languages to learn.

First, just a little background into data science.
What is data science? 

Data Science is the study of information — and most companies are using data science to help make business decisions, solve complex problems and create strategies to improve results and performance. Data science is also heavily involved in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.
Why should you become a data scientist?

Learning data science can lead to a very lucrative career with a vast amount of employment opportunities. The demand for data scientists has greatly increased in recent years, and it will continue to do so, making now the perfect time to begin your journey to becoming a data scientist. 

If a high paying job is what you are looking for, then data science is the right path for you. The average data scientist in the USA is making $113k per year, which is far beyond the national average income.  It’s also much higher than the average salary for than your typical data analyst.
How do I get started in data science?

Data science does not require a 4-year degree but it is still necessary to become highly educated in the field, especially in big data and math. The best way to do this is by learning one or a couple more programming languages that are used in the field. 

So, what coding languages do you need for data science? And what are the best language languages to learn to become a data scientist? We are going to take a deep dive into the many options that you should explore. 
What are programming languages? 

Programming languages, to put it simply, are the languages used to write lines of code that make up a software program. These lines of code are digital instructions, commands, and other syntaxes that are translated into digital output. There are 5 main types of programming languages:

    Procedural Programming Languages

    Functional Programming Languages

    Object-Oriented Programming Languages

    Scripting Programming Languages

    Logic Programming

Each of these programming language types serves different functions and has specific advantages and disadvantages. 
What you need to consider when choosing the best programming language for your data science career path

The first thing to consider is the goal that you are trying to accomplish. Different tasks will require different levels of knowledge and specific languages may be more suited for the tasks that you are looking to complete. 

Next you need to figure out how data science can help you accomplish the task at hand. Data science can automate or streamline many tasks that you may already be handling. This can save you a lot of time, and money. 

You also need to figure out how skilled you are in the programming language(s) that you already know, and then decipher if you are ready to take your knowledge and bring it to the next level. 

The last thing you will need to discover is at what scale your organization is using data science. This will help you determine what languages to learn as well as how you should learn to use them.
